# Final configurations for Github Pages (optional) 

After running the CI/CD workflow we can see that it created the branch gh-pages. To deploy the website we'll go into the GitHub settings for our repo click Pages in the menu to the left and then choose the gh-pages branch to deploy from!

You should now be able to visit your gatsby website at <your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>

Now go your own changes, create components and tests that you need and watch the CI/CD workflow at work! Thanks for finishing the tutorial, hope you've learnt something.
