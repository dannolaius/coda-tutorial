# Welcome to 'Creating a Robust Gatsby Web Service with Automated Testing and Deployment on GitHub'


This comprehensive hands-on tutorial provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up a Gatsby application, integrating automated testing, and deploying it using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages. Discover how to harness Gatsby’s powerful capabilities for fast data fetching and static site generation, leading to a fully functional web service hosted on GitHub Pages, complete with automated tests to ensure reliability and performance.

The tutorial also covers the integration of automated unit and integration tests, the configuration of CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions, and managing version control with Git. We plan to use personal access token (PAT) with permissions for a new repository for full hands on learning. Designed for developers of all skill levels, this tutorial empowers participants to gain practical experience with Gatsby and modern deployment strategies.

### Intended Learning Outcome

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to set up a Gatsby site with CI/CD using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages. You will also configure Jest for testing, ESLint for linting, and deploy your project securely. You will understand how to use create and use a fresh GitHub Repository in combination with a repo-scoped GitHub’s Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of their GitHub password to use and interact with git in an insecure online terminal environment that you should not fully trust. You will learn how a scoped token allows them to work safely without needing to trust the terminal with sensitive credentials, while still following standard workflows as upi would in your local development setup if you were using SSH authentication.
