# Welcome to 'Creating a Robust Gatsby Web Service with Automated Testing and Deployment on GitHub'


This comprehensive hands-on tutorial provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up a Gatsby application, integrating automated testing, and deploying it using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages. Discover how to harness Gatsbyâ€™s powerful capabilities for fast data fetching and static site generation, leading to a fully functional web service hosted on GitHub Pages, complete with automated tests to ensure reliability and performance.

The tutorial also covers the integration of automated unit and integration tests, the configuration of CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions, and managing version control with Git. We plan to use personal access token (PAT) with permissions for a new repository for full hands on learning. Designed for developers of all skill levels, this tutorial empowers participants to gain practical experience with Gatsby and modern deployment strategies.
